# Template Relevance Network for Retrosynthesis
A faithful (to the best of my ability) re-implementation (because the authors did not release the source code) of the expansion network in Segler's seminal [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25978): **"Planning chemical syntheses with deep neural networks and symbolic AI"**, which they [first published here](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.201605499) in **"Neural-Symbolic Machine Learning for Retrosynthesis and Reaction Prediction"**. In essence, NeuralSym is a feedforward network using Highway-ELU blocks, taking as input a product fingerprint (ECFP4), and producing as output an array of logits, one value for each template extracted from the training dataset. A softmax classification can be done across these logits to determine the most promising reaction template, which can be passed through RDChiral to generate the predicted precursors for this product. 

## Data files
This model has been re-trained on USPTO-50K dataset, which has ~50,000 atom-mapped reactions from US Patent data.
I have done some pre-processing on the original data from Schneider et al. to get slightly cleaner train/valid/test datasets, which have 39713/4989/5005 reaction SMILES respectively. These are in the 3 .pickle files in data/. From these 3 files, just do
```
    python prepare_data.py
```
to extract templates from training data, get the labels & so on. I have significantly optimized the code & it automatically parallelizes, so it shouldn't take long to prepare all the data on a standard 8/16-core machine, maybe 15 mins total (slowest step is the variance thresholding of 1 mil-dim fingerprints to 32681-dim fingerprints)

## Training
I have provided a sample ```train.sh``` file with sensible hyperparameters that achieved ~40% top-1 valid/test  in terms of template-matching accuracy. For reactant matching accuracy (this is what we ultimately care about), I can get ~45.5% top-1 and 87.4% top-50 accuracy, calculated using ```infer_all.py```. Just do
```
    bash -i train.sh 0
```
On 1x RTX2080 one epoch takes 8 seconds, and the whole training finishes in <5 minutes. 
The training arguments can be found in ```train.py``` & should be self-explanatory. I plan to do a quick bayesian optimization using Optuna, but don't expect any fancy improvements (<1% probably).

A fully trained model that scored 40.28% top-1 & 75.1% top-50 on the test set is uploaded on google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NUWo7Ir5bnCRMluAYf2LqAkMm-TmiQRz?usp=sharing) and you need to save it into the ```checkpoint/``` folder. The logs from training that model are also included in ```logs_sample/```.  Note that it is quite sizeable, ~374M, so I don't recommend checkpointing models until you're sure that you have what you need. 

I have also incorporated some neat visualization code in the validation/testing step to print some examples of reactions & the model's predictions, e.g.:
```
curr product:                       COC(=O)c1cccc2[nH]c(NCC3CCNCC3)nc12
pred template:                      [C:2]-[N&H1&D2&+0:1]-[C:3]>>C-C(-C)(-C)-O-C(=O)-[N&H0&D3&+0:1](-[C:2])-[C:3]
true template:                      [C:2]-[N&H1&D2&+0:1]-[C:3]>>C-C(-C)(-C)-O-C(=O)-[N&H0&D3&+0:1](-[C:2])-[C:3]
pred precursor (score = +0.9984):   ['COC(=O)c1cccc2[nH]c(NCC3CCN(C(=O)OC(C)(C)C)CC3)nc12']
true precursor (score = +0.9984):   COC(=O)c1cccc2[nH]c(NCC3CCN(C(=O)OC(C)(C)C)CC3)nc12

curr product:                       COc1ccc(I)c(OCC2CO2)c1
pred template:                      [#8:3]-[C:2]-[C&H2&D2&+0:1]-[O&H0&D2&+0:4]-[c:5]>>Cl-[C&H2&D2&+0:1]-[C:2]-[#8:3].[O&H1&D1&+0:4]-[c:5]
true template:                      [#8:3]-[C:2]-[C&H2&D2&+0:1]-[O&H0&D2&+0:4]-[c:5]>>Cl-[C&H2&D2&+0:1]-[C:2]-[#8:3].[O&H1&D1&+0:4]-[c:5]
pred precursor (score = +0.9820):   ['COc1ccc(I)c(O)c1.ClCC1CO1']
true precursor (score = +0.9820):   COc1ccc(I)c(O)c1.ClCC1CO1
```

## Inference
For my own purposes, I am first working on generating up to top-200 precursors across the entire train/valid/test datasets. This is in ```infer_all.py```.

But I have also done a simple API in ```infer_one.py``` that accepts a list of product SMILES and outputs a dictionary of top-K precursors & corresponding probabilities assigned by the model. This is just a sample to demonstrate the functionality - feel free to adapt as you wish!

Example:
```
{'COC(=O)c1cccc2[nH]c(NCC3CCNCC3)nc12': 
    [
        (['COC(=O)c1cccc2[nH]c(NCC3CCN(C(=O)OC(C)(C)C)CC3)nc12'], 0.9992377758026123), 
        (['COC(=O)c1cccc2[nH]c(NCC3CCN(C(=O)OCc4ccccc4)CC3)nc12'], 0.0002514408261049539), 
        (['COC(=O)c1cccc2[nH]c(NCC3CCN(C(=O)C(F)(F)F)CC3)nc12'], 0.00024452427169308066), 
        (['COC(=O)c1cccc2[nH]c(NCC3CCN(Cc4ccccc4)CC3)nc12'], 0.00012763732229359448), 
        (['COC(=O)c1cccc2[nH]c(NCc3ccncc3)nc12'], 4.4018081098329276e-05)
    ]}
```

Next in the pipeline: build a sample webapp that allows user to draw molecules & feed it into the infer_one API, followed by visualization of the proposed reactants & their probabilities.
